How does the plugin work? If in the distributor (yes, the distributor and not in the ejector, it is logical that in the ejector, but the distributor is more expensive, so I do not know ..) there is an empty bucket and there is a cow in front of it, aimed at its hole, within a radius of 1 block, then Mr. distributor, instead of throwing away the bucket, gives the cow to the last drop.
Plugin running on version 1.16-1.20.6

In the future, I will probably improve this plugin and also add support for newer versions
